\chapter{Summary and Conclusion}
ALICE has measured all single-charm hadron ground states in pp collisions at \tevf and \tevt.
Large enhancement of all charm baryons was measured in pp collisions with respect to \ee collisions.
The charm fragmentation fractions in pp collisions at \tevf were measured for the first time, showing that charm fragmentation is not universal across collision systems.
